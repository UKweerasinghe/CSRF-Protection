# CSRF-Protection

In this project Cross-site Request Forgery protection in web applications is tested.I have implement two web applications such as Synchronizer Token Pattern and Double Submit Cookies Pattern for the demostration. You can refer to my blog post (https://ichibablog.blogspot.com/) for further details.


Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as one-click attack is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser(https://en.wikipedia.org).
